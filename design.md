# 🌟 COSMIC COLLECTION STATION
*A wholesome procedural mining-builder for Mini Jam 185*

## 🎯 CORE CONCEPT
You're a deep space prospector building your dream mining station from scratch. Start with a tiny 1-room outpost and expand it by collecting resources and discovering ancient alien artifacts. Each expedition brings back materials to add new modules, and each station upgrade unlocks better mining capabilities. The ultimate goal: find the 5 legendary Master Artifacts to build the magnificent Tier 5 Stellar Research Station.
